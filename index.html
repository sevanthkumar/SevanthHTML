<h1> Sevanth Kumar </h1>
<p>
This is the first web page I've ever made,
and I'm extremely proud of it.
It is so cool!
India is my country and all Indians are my Brothers and Sisters.
I love my country and I am proud of its rich and varied heritage.
I shall always strive to be worthy of it.
I shall give respect to my parents, teachers and all the elders and treat everyone with courtesy.
To my country and my people, I pledge my devotion.
In their well being and prosperity alone, lies my happines
